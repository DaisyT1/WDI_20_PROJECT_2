#BookWorm
-

This Ruby on Rails app allows you to upload your photos, crate personal stroies and read them from anywhere in the world. This was the second project I created whilst at General Assembly on their WDI course. You can see a live demo [here](https://young-earth-46657.herokuapp.com/).

##Additions
In the future I would like to change the user interface and introduce AJAX, for a better user experience. I would also like to create a joint, yet seperate account, so children can have their own login section, view the same stories as the parent account, but remove the full CRUD abilities.
